# website-starter-gulp

A super simple basic web project setup using Gulp, Tailwind, and some CSS & JS compressors.

### Usage

1. Download the project and extract to a folder on your system.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt in that folder.
3. Type the following commands:

`npm install` - you only need to do this the first time

`./node_modules/.bin/gulp watch`

When you edit the files in the `app` folder they will get compiled and moved to `dist`, and your browser will auto reload to show the results.
